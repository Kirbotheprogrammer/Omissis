<h1 style="text-align: center;">End Poem</h1>
<div class="End_poem"><p class="End">
 At the end of almost any Japanese work, the author usually dedicates the final pages to a postscript: a personal space where they share doubts about the future, reflect on their relationship with the work, and reveal what inspired it.
 The postscript is never a marginal addition, but rather a living and essential part of the work itself.<br>
<br>And so, these words are meant to be my postscript.
While writing this “letter,” I still haven’t decided how the video will end. I keep struggling with myself: on one hand, the desire to leave a message; on the other, the fear it might turn out too long or too sentimental. Even now, I don’t know if what you’re hearing will actually make it into the final version.
 Perhaps this really is the last video, the last script I’ve worked on with such persistence and without rest.<br>
<br>While writing, I tried to suppress the fear that all of this will eventually come to an end. Chats are becoming silent, messages rarer, and the chance to meet again more and more unlikely. Nights grow longer, seemingly quiet, while the echo of regrets for choices left unmade becomes deafening. And so another night runs its course, filled with endless thoughts and sleepless hours.<br>
<br>The trembling advice I try to gather from friends often turns into long and tangled paranoias. And amidst it all, what both distances me from and reconciles me with myself is this very video this legacy.<br>
It’s hard to explain what it means to go from hundreds of messages waiting for replies… to nothing. Solitude isn’t new to me, but this time it has taken on a different face. Because despite everything, I was not alone: this has been the longest period of reflection in my life, and at the same time, the one most filled with company. I’ve shared this path with incredible people who contributed in their own small ways, even though they could have easily stepped back.<br>
<br>So then, what is truly the problem?
That’s the question I kept asking myself as I patiently edited clip after clip. Which brings us back to the original doubt: should I leave these words not in search of pity, but of genuine listening or should I simply end everything with a celebration, even though, in reality, the celebration has long been over?<br>
<br>Before these words feel out of place, let me say this: I envisioned The SpainLands as a tribute, something to be watched by many, where anyone might find a fragment of themselves within these reflections.
I hate to admit it, but I truly miss that time of discovery in the very first days. Whether it was our departure or theirs doesn’t matter: it felt as if an invisible shield surrounded us all. Now that shield seems to have weakened, yet it still lingers, waiting day after day to be reforged. It’s a heartbreaking feeling. There isn’t much you can do… or at least, not much I can do.<br>
<br>During my days in Spain, I once asked a question that, I believe, connects well to this reflection:
 “When all of this ends, will we go back to the way we were?”
 The answer I received is something I’d rather not repeat. My answer, however, is: “No.”
 Not because everyone has forgotten, but because each of us has taken in what we experienced and kept moving forward.<br>
<br>I, too, have tried to move forward, trying to be as understanding as possible. Yet, despite the silence, I kept fighting with myself over something I may not even have done. I know. I’m breaking my initial promise not to write a message too long or overly sentimental. But allow me just a moment.
Many told me: “Let it go, move on.”
 But can we really let go of someone with whom we’ve shared so much?<br> <br>I don’t think so. That’s why I categorically rejected the advice I often heard: to walk away voluntarily, to erase someone. Erase. A word I find cold, almost derogatory.
Maybe my refusal hasn’t brought me much benefit. And yet, little by little, I feel I’m neither forgetting nor denying: I’m learning to accept. To accept even the idea that someone might wish to forget me. And I accept it.
This video is also for those who simply want to watch and enjoy, while perhaps listening to these reflections in the background.
But I can’t deny it: I am afraid.<br>
<br> My greatest fear is to one day look back at what I’ve done and realize it was all meaningless. A fear almost ironic, considering that last August I had to start from scratch after my computer wiped everything. In some ways, it’s even laughable, don’t you think?
Originally, I thought I would end with Julian Gough’s End Poem. But I changed my mind. I prefer these words, because they feel more authentic, more ours.
To those listening: I hope I haven’t bored you too much. And in any case, I’m almost finished.
And as for the future?<br>
<br> I think I’ll release an extended version of An Erasmus Movie 1, combined with this latest work. But beyond projects, when I look ahead, I picture a space where I’ll overcome fears and regrets, and where I’ll see again the people I’ve cherished along this journey.
Because the real lesson I’ve taken from all this is simple: maintaining a relationship is essential. Dialogue is indispensable. When it is missing, countless misunderstandings and unpleasant outcomes can arise.
And I believe and with this I conclude that every path needs its own moment of reflection.<br>
<br> Unconsciously, each of us must have asked ourselves the inevitable question: “And now?”
 Especially after something so important.
The only advice I can offer is this: take time to reflect, but don’t let your thoughts consume your nights or give you headaches as they did to me. If you cannot or don’t want to speak, then write. And afterward, gather the courage so that someone, someday, might listen.
Because if there’s one thing this project has taught me, it’s that in every situation, whatever it may be, adaptability and acceptance are our only keys to move forward.<br>
<br>After all, each of us is made of the same particles that compose the stars and galaxies: a shared source code, both the same and different for each of us.
And in the end, each of us similar yet unique, distant yet close is nothing but love.<br>
